Provide education on how to invest so they may even be able to beat the ROI provided by those who manage the ERS.  Daunting task but it can be done.

Dying is is a series of shut-downs and can sometimes be reversed before the actual final closure. Therefore, a recovery is not a ""return-from-the-dead"" ... because the death never occurred.

It seems so reasonable - use the private sector where you can select the quality of care. Certainly proponents of the Canadian system have been working for years/decades and we still have too few hospital beds. Beds in hallways.

Then, the burden of proof was on Catherine, and the operative word is ""proof"". Catherine's unsupported word should not have sufficed, and at the time she made this claim, she was not a virgin. Thus, she had no support whatsoever for her claim. Church marriage law holds that dubious claims about the validity of the marriage are to be dismissed in favor of the validity.

However, her other point of attack depended on her nephew Charles -- King of Spain, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Naples -- to oppose the annulment. Charles disliked Henry both personally and politically, and was happy to help his aunt. 

More importantly, in 1527, Naples and the Papal States had a war, which the Pope lost. Pope Clement VII did not want a re-run of that war, so he stalled by taking Catherine's claim seriously. There were special commissions and so on to waste time.",10,"However, Catherine did not want her marriage annulled. She claimed that she loved Henry; a dubious claim at best, since Henry did not treat her well. It is far more likely that Catherine did not want her daughter, Mary, to lose her place as Henry's only legitimate child. Should Henry remarry and have a son, this son would take precedence over Mary as Henry's heir. 

So, Catherine counter-attacked on two fronts: One based in Church marriage law, the other political. In Church marriage law, in order for a marriage to be valid, two things must happen. The first is an exchange of vows before witnesses, and there was no question that Catherine and Arthur did this. The second is that the marriage must be consummated. Catherine claimed that she and Arthur had never had intercourse. Thus, the dispensation was irrelevant, and her marriage to Henry was, in fact, her first marriage.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[45598378, 45366683, 45476019, 45454484, 45377221]"

Of course, the Archbishop's point is sweeping, but it's also true. 

When the prevailing thought among the intelligentsia (and the want to be intelligentsia) today is ""there is no absolute truth"", that by itself is an attack on reason (truth).

When the world seems to be saying ""I was born this way"", of course, that's an attack on free will.

It's not impossible to do this.
All a person has to do is not go into the bank like a kid in a candy shop and take out the biggest mortgage the bank will give you.  And make sure he or she pays off the credit cards at the end of the month.  And buy a well maintained pre-owned care (or even better, take the bus).  And build up a nice reserve fund of three to six months expenses.  And learning how to cook so you don't have to eat out three times a day seven days a week.

Well, five years later, I renewed my mortgage for five years at a lower interest rate, and kept the payments the same.  (Faster pay down of principal.)

Then, I renewed the mortgage for another five years at an even lower interest rate.  And again, I kept the payments the same size.

The result is that my 25 year mortgage is going to be paid off in under 20 years.

I know I could still support said mortgage without increasing payments, even if mortgage rates rose to 10%.

You may start out with similarly situated people  in a risk pool, but what happens when you get a catastrophic illness? Suddenly you're not similarly situated. What happens then? Do you get shunted off to the high risk pool? Who pays for that?

Basing insurance costs solely on calculated risks is what we had before the ACA. It allowed insurance companies to cherry pick healthy customers and deny coverage to the sick. They could even jack up the rates for existing customers who got sick to a level where the couldn't pay anymore, and they'd have to drop the policy. And then there were the $1 million lifetime caps, which anyone with a serious illness could easily exceed.

Insurance is not ""health care."" Health *insurance* is something you buy based on your actuarial and calculated risk to provide supplemental (to your own responsible savings) money to cover potential and foreseeable, but not certain, health care costs in the future. The cost of your insurance should be based, as it is with all other insurance, on similarly situated people with equivalent coverage in a risk pool based on actuarial calculations. The conflation of routine health care, which for most people should be as much a cash-based process as vehicle or home maintenance, with insurance for unforeseeable risks and savings plans for things like childbirth and elder care, is what has brought our health care system to this point.

The Royal Commission was very critical of the clericalism of the Catholic Church, of the efforts by bishops everywhere to protect the reputation of priests and of the Church with (an utter) disregard for the need to protect children and deal with sexual abusers.  Among many issues raised, there was discussion of the lack of females in decision making/governance roles.   There was also pointed discussion regarding mandatory reporting of information received regarding child sex abuse, including what was/is learned in the confessional.

CO2 is indeed plant food but the data confirms  that global plant life is unable to assimilate the increase in CO2 concentration caused by human activities since the industrial revolution.

Thatcher's original claim was that ""G&M ranks 3,000+ in global web site traffic and RT is 350"" -  ""website traffic"", not viewers.

He was hilariously wrong, as my link proved.

Either way, your figures are wildly off.

CNN has 2M viewers weekly?

Fox has 3.5M viewers weekly?

Here's the hard numbers:

""Daytime viewership was also dominated by Fox as it pulled in 2.09 million. CNN’s programming reeled in 1.04 million viewers and MSNBC finished third at 695K.""

I didn’t mean to limit the discussion to vertebrates; I was merely trying to focus on higher animals since some lower creatures are asexual (protozoa) or hermaphrodites (earthworms).  But you are right that many invertebrates show a sexual division of labour too.
If I may say so,  I think your questions miss the point (‘Just what is it you would like to prevent me and other women from doing? What is the supposedly genetically determined role you would like to impose on us?’).  It’s not an issue of 'preventing' of 'imposing'.  Rather, why would you want to play a male role (or I a female)?  I don’t see the logic in that.",5,"I am including the link to clownfish below

Just what is it you would like to prevent me and other women from doing? What is the supposedly genetically determined role you would like to impose on us?

Should I wear a veil? Not speak in public?

Among some vertebrate species, the males are relegated to the periphery of the society, or must fight to mate. Is that a role you would like for yourself (assuming you are a male)? Do you really want to copy the behavior of other species such as -- musk oxen, chimps, or sharks? You can be a musk ox if you like, but I am not.
I wonder why you are limiting the discussion to vertebrates. You don't care to discuss sea horses or queen bees or praying mantids? We could talk about clownfish. They are vertebrates.

In the last couple weeks here in Kodiak, trawl deckhands have told of a massive trawl of dead, ping pong paddle sized halibut, shoveled over dead.

The Commission’s job is to determine whether female deacons were the equivalent of male deacons in our history, whether both received the sacrament of Holy Orders.

Experts who answer No rely on the solid evidence that male and female deacons did different things, and therefore are not the same. Experts who answer Yes rely on the equally solid evidence that the ordination rituals for male and female deacons are fully equivalent.

Personally, the equivalency of the rituals (laying on of hands, invocation of the Holy Spirit, ordination inside the inconostasis) decides the question. The effort to denigrate female deacons because they historically did different things, would be like saying only priests who minister in parishes (versus priests assigned to teach) are real priests, or only bishops who run dioceses (versus bishops who run the Vatican or its diplomatic service) are real bishops.

Those who live in Anchorage and have been witness to his efforts to promote discrimination against LGBTQ Alaskans will not be surprised at Minnery and Leman's inability to negotiate the concept of Equal Protection.The civil protections afforded by our Constitution cannot be treated as trivialities to be glossed over-- no matter what the goal.

There are plenty of ideas dear to the political left that make fine examples of science denialism, and these ideas range from the denial of the role of biology on human behavior (just like religionists') to permitting the spread of malaria. Secondly, science relies mostly on inductive and abductive reasoning, and as such, ""the unknowns"" are not known, and this is why facts can be revised over time. While the components of a model may proven, the logical entailments between them can be lacking. Also, the peer review process may have been at one time what Mr. Box describes, but that is no longer the case, there is a lot of inducement in the current enterprise of science to lead scientists to collude. Lastly, peer review is the collection of opinions, so science is a matter concerning opinion, just like critiques of math proofs asserted to answer difficult mathematical problems.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[45438681, 45450096, 45191524, 45586742, 45602467]"

    The New York Times obtained more than 500 pages of internal records that suggest there’s far more to the story than this, including disagreements about cell phone risks among its scientists and agency officials.

    When the CDC warning was first made public, government and health officials wondered whether it represented a policy change (and whether schools could be liable for allowing cell phones on their premises).

    The CDC then began to regret their choice of words, and internal emails show officials debating how to best backpedal, including stating that other countries such as the UK and Canada (but apparently not the U.S.) recommended caution.

    Not all officials agreed that a revision was necessary, however. The New York Times reported:5",4,"Yes,  thanks for letting me know that there is no science.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York said Thursday that it has created a compensation program for people who were sexually abused by priests or deacons and are willing to forego lawsuits in exchange for an award to be determined by an independent mediator.

Some advocates for sex abuse victims immediately assailed the program as an attempt to squash cases quickly, before New York's legislature acts on a proposal to make it easier for victims to sue over abuse that happened years ago.

Under the plan, announced by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, people with abuse claims already pending with the church would have a limited time window -- until Jan. 31 -- to apply for compensation.

The archdiocese said it had hired mediators Camille Biros and Kenneth Feinberg to evaluate the claims and decide how much victims would be paid. Fox News",10,"Jim I went to the Journal..the first 170 cases are beyond the SOLs but cases must accept the payment in lieu of litigation:

The archdiocese’s compensation effort will begin immediately, with administrators first reaching out to the 170 people who have previously lodged complaints but haven’t been compensated, Mr. Feinberg said. The statute of limitations in all those cases has expired, he said.

In evaluating whether claims are justifiable, administrators will accept and consider evidence “both direct and circumstantial,” including reports made at the time the alleged abuse occurred, complaints made against known abusers, medical and psychiatric records, Mr. Feinberg said.

First, not only do nuns not cover their faces, it has been decades since they wore the traditional habit with the full veil and skirts to the floor.

If He was raised from the dead, which I believe He was, He has very much authority on true spirituality.  He said that he will be the judge of those in this world.

She claims that she is following Christ by being an apostate, but if you look at what Christ taught, its very evident that she is missing the mark of submission to Christs authority.  About the poor and needy, it should be our joy and mission in accordance with the gospel to serve their needs.  Forced giving by government or by the law is where the pretense seeps in.

The accusations are not mine. However I've signed a few petitions that were widely circulated that pointed out the violations of International Law and Treaties that Israel had agreed to uphold.

A few property management corporations with shady global dealings have been condemned for working with the government of Israel for renting these stolen properties in several sites where the owners have been dispossessed from their historical land holdings.

""Jesus said to his disciples, “Things that cause sin will inevitably occur, but woe to the one through whom they occur. It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.
Be on your guard!  If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him."" (Luke 7:1-3)

There is also insufficient science to refute claims of toxic impact on Hawaii's people and environment.

Chretien sent both Arar and Khadr  in to foreign custody where the lesser elements of humanity were allowed to run amok. Arar just happened to be transiting through the wrong place at the wrong time.

He trained as other 15 year olds did in Afghanistan, to become a Taliban foot soldier, and was considered such because he had entered Puberty. Different country, different values.

 Would Trudeau have paid Khadr the 10.5 Million if Khadr had been born in Afghanistan instead of Toronto? If Arar had not been paid the same amount would Khadr's payment have been less? Its interesting how this debate turns in to a Canadian values argument even though Khadr was in fact living the lesser values of Afghan life.

Here is one similarity...

It becomes even more apparent when one compares the core organizing principles of these two ideologies of Carbonism and Communism. While Communism seeks to marshal or harness the economic and political power of the nation-state by organizing through the idea of the worker. Carbonism although similarly structured, takes the organizing principle to the next level – first by substituting the nation-state for the world, and then by directly linking the combined economic and political power of each individual in the world, to the carbon footprint each creates in the world. And in the global context of Carbonism, this individual can either be a person, corporation or business.

As an aside, in many legal systems of this world, the corporation has the legal standing of an individual.",5,"Carbonism is the new Communism  

With the latest climate conference over, and the agenda set for the next year, it is becoming clear just what climate change really means. With the conference putting in place the functional structures needed for the development of global carbon regulation, climate change is now finally showing its true colors…  

It is the first truly global ideology.  

Until now, it was difficult to see just exactly what evolutionary trajectory climate change would take. But with Brexit and the opening of a new postmodern path for the Western world, one can now see clearly through this new lens that the issue of climate change is nothing but the ultimate when it comes to the concept of political ideologies. When describing or defining this new ideology, a modernist will call it climate change, but a postmodern philosopher, will see it clearly as Carbonism.

One paper I referred to is here,
http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2011.1/BIO-C.2011.1
It basically illustrates why non-beneficial serial mutations are limited.
Admittedly, I was shooting from the hip, with my references, as I read a great number of articles and have difficulty finding them again when needed to support an argument.
I am aware bacteria covers the world, I was referring to the imaginary concept of one bacterial type, trying to overcome the same survival hurtle, covering the world.  These are the numbers necessary for even modest serial mutations.
If you are a true believer in the random mutation/ natural selection source for all biological information, then please consider the math.  That is science.

What I don't believe in is some kid who is 18 - who very likely first tried cigarettes when he was 12-14 because some other 18-year old ""adult"" offered him cigarettes - and who is now addicted - going out and buying cigarettes for some other 12-14-year old.

It is a senseless cycle.

We scream bloody murder about the illegal drugs pouring in from other countries, but allow US cigarette companies to addict our kids - and to export cigarettes to other countries.

The American tobacco industry accounts for less than 1% of our national economy, but our political system has never shut them down.  But we can't figure out why those OTHER countries cannot get their illegal drug growers and manufacturers in check - though in those countries that industry can account for 40-60% of their GDP.

Nicotine is an addictive poison. It's derivatives are in certain insecticides. Perhaps the board with all its superior knowledge could endorse raising awareness about the roots of addiction and mental illness instead of a heavy handed, bass ackwards decision making possession of tobacco illegal to people under 21.

Will WRAP include increased public restrooms, even ""honey pots"", and trash and dump stations, so we won't have to relieve ourselves or dump sewage and garbage on streets, park ways, or in peoples yards? Will there be noise regulations forbidding loud arguing, drinking, or running generators after 10PM? Will campfires be allowed?

The media report highlighted the case of a young woman who attended a party with her own vodka mix - she openly admitted that she was intoxicated to the point where she actually passed out - so why would the police officer not question her credibility and the facts of the incident
There is no problem with the police reviewing / updating procedures in cases of reported sexual violence
BUT we need not to go on a Salem witch hunt driven by politicians in a hurry to judgement looking for a new cause célèbre !

You don't seem to include advocating that non-white Kingdom land-owners should also turn over all their lands to the State for the benefit of all.

False.  A scurrilous personal attack.  My essential argument is that Hawaiian natives welcomed European, American, and Asian newcomers as full partners. The unified Kingdom embracing all islands and all people had never before happened and could not have been achieved without newcomer participation.  Natives supplied land.  Newcomers supplied capital investment, labor, and expertise.  Natives eagerly engaged in cultural appropriation of written language, Christianity, and rule of law.  It is both illegal and immoral for descendants of one partner to now demand land and power for themselves exclusively, which is what the proposed constitution for a ""Hawaiian nation"" clearly demands.

The writer you target with sarcasm actually wrote this:

""With the price of housing so high (and yes, it drive rents up too), more people are not able to save adequately for retirement.""

That writer is fully correct. MORE PEOPLE (as in, increasing numbers of young working families locked out of local house price ranges) are impaired to save adequately for retirement as result of skyrocketing house prices. Those high prices expand two sets of people in society: The numbers of renters increase (who do not get a house buying opportunity of the sort that previous generations did) and overstretched buyers increase in numbers (who extend so much of their income on mortgage payments that they have less disposable income to buy products and services that would employ their neighbours).

On the other hand, a text on the order of, ""The next time I see you, I'm gonna blow your head off,"" would be an entirely different matter because a reasonable person would interpret it to be a clear threat to inflict physical harm which is a crime, if only a misdemeanor. 

So it all hinges on what Kelly actually texted, of which nothing has been publicly released.",5,Look at all the people that knew and nothing said or done? File lawsuits or press charges.,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[45445192, 45465124, 45440506, 45597944, 45597373]"

They brought on the PERS debacle - making outrageous, unsustainable pension promises to a generation of public employees - based on earnings projections that far exceeded what the national business cycle could possibly deliver - stemming from investment of those public pension dollars with KKR and other leveraged buyout kings - who took it and plundered/raped private companies operating right here in the Northwest - with no regard to the jobs of the employees of those private companies.

Then, along the way, they compounded the outrage - convincing almost all Oregon public employers to engage in a political lie:  Most private company employees were suffering through years of little increase in their wages.  So the unions said to the elected officials, ""Why don't you just ""pick-up"" our employee contributions - hiding our wage increases.""

Your math on the PREMIUM increases is correct. I was never disputing that part. Only the suggestion that it was about profits, when it's actually about costs. 

I disagree about major changes to what we have now not doing any better at controlling costs, however. I definitely think there are ideas that would better control costs compared to this.

I specifically did not claim the 30%/40% was pure profit. My statement of the cost increase as it applies to an individual's premiums was correct - if you pay $1000 per month now, your premium will increase 30%, for a yearly sum of $3600. Was my math bad?
As far as the cost of the actual care is concerned, that's not part of what I've talking about. Yes, the costs for doctors and services increases every year, and that is going to happen with any replacement for Obamacare. People who think their premiums will decrease are only fooling themselves.

The selection you shared doesn't contradict what I've said. To start, my statement was about sex offenders generally, not just child molesters. The numbers you're providing are regarding child molesters in particular. 
Further, if you look at the line directly before the line you've cited, it reads: ""The researchers reported that 5.1 percent of the child molesters in the study were rearrested for a new sex crime within 3 years of their release..."" meaning that 95% of child molesters were not re-arrested for a new sex crime. 
The numbers you have cited have to do with comparing subsets of child molesters: those with more than one prior arrest versus those with only one type of prior arrest. 
Lastly, regarding the bit that starts with ""As might be expected..."", what they're saying here is that child molesters were more likely than other types of sex offenders to commit a sex crime against a child after release, which is different than re-offense rates.
Does that clear things up?",10,"Ingrid said:  ""Sex offenders in general have very low re-offense rates (compared to other types of offenders).""

This contradicts what you just said. Please explain why: 

""Similar to the pattern for rapists, child molesters with
more than one prior arrest had an overall recidivism rate
nearly double (44.3 percent compared to 23.3 percent)
that of child molesters with only one prior arrest. As
might be expected, child molesters were more likely
than any other type of offender—sexual or nonsexual—
to be arrested for a sex a crime against a child following
release from prison.""

Now, that Kubes is re-imagining a new career path, Elway helps him again by hiring him as a scout. 

I was at a charity meeting that Elway attended after Kubes had left. He gave a speech about how his family had battled illness and how he had watched his best friend Kubiak go through hell battling pain. He was clearly upset about the entire situation and hated to see his friend leave due to illness.

Not good. In fact, weak.
However, with more playing time, a desire to fit in and a mean, brutish disposition, Kasim Edebali just might get to the quarterback nine times, maybe more, this year alone.
He looked good for the Saints.
As for Shaquille Barrett and Shane Ray, homegrown and fat fed on the turf at The House of the Horse, they better start looking over their shoulders.
Ray says no one can stop him for an entire game. He, Ray says, can earn a sack in any game at any time.
Yeah, that's why you only had eight sacks in 16 games last season in Denver's forgettable cameo appearance in the NFL.
Ray either played at half-speed or only played half-heartedly. Either way, Ray is clearly a half-time player, kinda like CJ Anderson, a notorious slacker.

Fluoridation opponents (FOs) make claims that directly contradict nearly all evidence that has been accumulated for over 70 years.  When you invest the time and effort to actually examine the alleged ""evidence"" provided by FOs, you will quickly see that the conclusions have been modified so a possible correlation becomes absolute proof, studies are irrelevant to the issue of fluoridation (very high exposure levels caused harm) or studies are misrepresented, like the 2015 Cochrane Fluoride review.

Why do you non-science/engineer types always grab wrong data and present it as facts? Seriously.

Because, a typical base is about 30x50x20 (ft), which ~1000 cubic yards. A cubic yard is about 2 tons, so, that means that it is 2000 tons, NOT 30,000 tons. It is not even CLOSE so that you put. 
SO, lets continue doing the REAL math on this.
Now, you assume that coal is what is used to heat the cement, yet, that is wrong. Electricity is all that is required. As such, the REAL issue is what is the grid doing.
1) http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/05/09/emissions-from-the-cement-industry/
""Producing a ton of cement requires 4.7 million BTU of energy, equivalent to about 400 pounds of coal, and generates nearly a ton of CO2. ""
2) but, our grid, is NOT 100% coal. It is currently less than 30% coal, but we will go with 30.
SO, 400 lbs x .30 x 2000 = 240,000 LBs of coal, or 120 tons.

Second, the habitat gained by removal has, amazing as it might seem to you, been used by salmon, and used quite extensively.

The reason Trump won is that turn-out among urban blacks and other members of the Obama coalition was way down in places where national policies placed them at an especial disadvantage.
That turnout was down because the Democratic Party nominated an uninspiring, terribly-flawed, worst-possible candidate - a congenital liar who endangered national security (intentionally and carelessly using an email server less secure than gmail), who refused to take responsibility for her mistakes (e.g. Benghazi) and who had been selling influence to the highest bidder for decades - from Little Rock to Big Banks to Deplorable Foreign Capitals.
